# Rstudio-Dark-Theme
This is a custom dark theme for Rstudio. Uses black backgrounds, dark colors, and high-contrast/neon accents.
## Features

*   **Pure Black Background:**  The main editor background is a true black (`rgb(0, 0, 0)`), providing a deep, distraction-free canvas for coding.
*   **Dark Color Palette:**  A predominantly dark and desaturated color scheme is used for the UI, ensuring readability and minimizing harsh light.
*   **High-Contrast/Neon Accents:** Key syntax elements are highlighted with bright, contrasting colors such as aqua, neon pink, and light green for easy identification.
*  **Improved Terminal Colors:** the colors of the terminal have been customized and improved to give more diversity and a brighter look while still being on a black background.
*   **Custom Scrollbar:** Transparent scrollbars, almost invisible until hover, for improved aesthetics.
*   **Comprehensive Theming:**  Includes styling for the editor, console, data grids, menus, toolbars, and the RStudio terminal, offering a consistent experience.
